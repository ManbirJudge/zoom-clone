# Zoom Clone
A Zoom clone made using Express, Socket.IO and PeerJS

## Note
Zoom clone 2.0 is under developement. I will post the repositry on Github soon (hopefully).

## Motivation
I wanted to learn Socket.IO and PeerJS. It was the time of the COVID  when I started this project. I (as all the students) was using Zoom to attend the classes online. So I thought why not make a Zoom clone.

## What's new? (till the intial developement)
I made the code understandable (hopefully), fixed some bugs and features that did not function properly and added 1-2 quality of life features.
